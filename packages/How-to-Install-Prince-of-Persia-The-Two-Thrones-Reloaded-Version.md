If you want to play this game on your PC, you might have downloaded the reloaded version from a torrent site or a file-sharing platform. However, you might encounter some problems during the installation process, such as asking for a password or a CD key. In this article, we will show you how to install Prince of Persia The Two Thrones reloaded version without any hassle.
 
## Step 1: Download the Game Files
 
The first step is to download the game files from a reliable source. You can use one of the links provided by Skidrow & Reloaded Games[^1^] [^2^], which is a website that offers cracked games for free. Alternatively, you can use a torrent client like uTorrent or BitTorrent to download the game files from a magnet link or a torrent file.
 
The size of the game files is about 4.15 GB for the Skidrow & Reloaded version and 1.6 GB for the P2P version. Make sure you have enough space on your hard drive before downloading.
 
## Step 2: Extract the Game Files
 
The next step is to extract the game files from the compressed archive. You will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to do this. Right-click on the archive file and select "Extract Here" or "Extract to" and choose a destination folder.
 
If you are asked for a password during the extraction process, you can use one of these passwords:
 
- www.skidrowreloaded.com (for the Skidrow & Reloaded version)
- www.pcgames-download.net (for the P2P version)

These passwords are also mentioned in the NFO file or the README file that comes with the archive.
 
## Step 3: Mount or Burn the ISO File
 
After extracting the game files, you will find an ISO file in the destination folder. This is a disc image file that contains all the data of the game disc. You will need to mount this file on a virtual drive or burn it on a physical disc to install the game.
 
To mount the ISO file, you can use a program like Daemon Tools or PowerISO. Right-click on the ISO file and select "Mount Image" or "Open With" and choose your virtual drive program. This will create a virtual drive on your PC that will act as if you inserted the game disc.
 
To burn the ISO file, you will need a blank DVD and a DVD burner. You can use a program like Nero or ImgBurn to burn the ISO file on the disc. Insert the blank DVD into your DVD burner and launch your burning program. Select "Burn Image" or "Write Image" and choose the ISO file and your DVD burner as the source and destination respectively. Start the burning process and wait until it finishes.
 
## Step 4: Install the Game
 
The final step is to install the game on your PC. To do this, open your virtual drive or insert your physical disc into your DVD drive and run the setup.exe file. Follow the instructions on the screen and choose your preferred language and installation directory.
 
If you are asked for a CD key during the installation process, you can use one of these keys:

- BZ7A9-X488N-725MY-E9FND-TLPDZ (for Skidrow & Reloaded version)
- 6N8C-8KGG-9K9D-9K9D-6RLD (for P2P version)

These keys are also mentioned in the NFO file or the README file that comes with the archive.
